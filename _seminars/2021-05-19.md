title:      "Designing Transparent &amp; Effective Content Moderation"

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit make millions of decisions everyday about
  which posts can stay online and which posts are removed. How these moderation decisions are
  made has important consequences for many of the key problems that the Internet faces today -
  fake news, online harassment, online radicalization, and censorship. My research builds a
  foundation for designing transparent and effective content moderation systems. I compliment
  data science methods with qualitative methods to (1) incorporate fairness and transparency in
  content removals and (2) examine the effectiveness of a range of moderation strategies in
  combating online hate groups. My findings show that (1) offering explanations for post
  removals improves both user attitudes and user behaviors and (2) implementing design
  frictions that impede access to controversial communities makes it more difficult for hate
  groups to recruit new members. In this talk, I will discuss how I conducted this research and
  articulate the lessons learned from this work for the benefit of site managers, moderators, and
  designers of moderation systems.

  at the University of Washington. He is joining the School of Communication and Information at
  Rutgers University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2021. Shagun’s research examines the
  governance mechanisms of internet platforms to understand how their design, technical
  affordances, and policies affect public discourse. He has worked with social media sites like
  Reddit and Twitch, and his research has impacted their efforts to address societal challenges
  such as online harassment and the rise of hate groups. His work has received two Best Paper
  Awards (at CSCW and ICWSM), one Best Paper Honorable Mention Award (at CSCW) and been
  featured in Editor’s Spotlight in TOCHI. His research has also received attention in the popular
